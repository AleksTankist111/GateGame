Some space is available for you to put there gates.
Each gate not wider than 10 cells, but can be of any height(depends of number of I/O)
PLEASE USE NAMES <6 symbols length of!
Example of using the game:
--create SRC s1 5 5, s2 5 10
--create NOT my1 15 5, my2 15 10
--create AND my3 25 6
--create PIP s3 35 7
--connect SRCs1 0, NOTmy1 0
--connect SRCs2 0, NOTmy2 0
--connect NOTmy1 0, ANDmy3 0
--connect NOTmy2 0, ANDmy3 1
--connect ANDmy3 0, PIPs3 0
--run 2
--set SRCs1 True
--change SRCs2
--run
This set of commands will create the NOT-OR gate on the board, and then on the Sink s2
you will see the value you received. After than you change the initial values on sources.
Then you will notice that value on the sink has changed.
